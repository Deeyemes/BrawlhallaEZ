# BrawlhallaEZ
A Brawlhalla EXP/Coin Farming bot.

In this version, you can unfocus the Brawlhalla window and the bot will continue to run in the background.

No need to set your controls either, as they are set by default. Just click done and you'll be okay! :D

Plans for next update:
- Adding a better fighting algorithm. (Less falling?)
- Add more things to the gui
- Still working on the "Auto everything" bot
